    description: "After spending several dozen hours manually annotating phage genomes, I realized at least part of the process could be done programatically, and Geneysis was born. \
                  Based around the idea that phages have very close relatives, Geneysis attempts to cluster a group of phages proteins into 'phams', and makes sure each gene in the \
                  pham starts at roughly the same place. Still in development, and available soon on Github.",

                  energy usage, along with an address and the arrangement of the panels, and calculates that person's individualized savings after switching to solar. It displays all relevent \
                  information in a self designed PDF which contains the important charts and figures the client needs to make an informed decision about solar energy. This is used daily by \
                  the staff at <a target='_blank' href='http://www.briosolarenergy.com'>Brio Energy</a>, and has generated almost 15,000 proposals to date.",
