Working in coordination the Institute for Systems Biology, and as part of the NCI Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots, I used Google's Cloud Services to reprocess several terabytes of genomic data hosted in Google Storage in only a matter of hours. We are currently working towards reprocessing all of TCGA using the read-quantification program Kallisto.",
