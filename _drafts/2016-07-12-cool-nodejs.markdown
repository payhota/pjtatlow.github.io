I've recently started building the user interface for the Geneysis project, and since I'm more familiar with web technologies
than any other method of building user interfaces, I decided to use [Electron](http://electron.atom.io)! If you haven't heard of Electron, it's a project 
started by GitHub to allow people to build cross platform desktop applications using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is the core of their [Atom]
(http://atom.io) text editor. It's been used by lots of big names (Microsoft, Slack, Wordpress), and since it runs on NodeJS pretty much any Node package 
can be used with electron. Here I'm going to keep a list of some of the cool node packages that I've used or seen that I want to keep an eye on.
