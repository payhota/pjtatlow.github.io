I thought I was in love before, but I was wrong. Python came to me in a world filled with C++, and it's clean syntax and ease of use won me over in a 
heartbeat. Python quickly became my go-to language for pretty much anything I needed to do. I overlooked it's slowness saying I was saving so much time 
actually writing the code that it didn't matter. But then I found Go. Go is a newer programming language cooked up by some guys over at Google, and it's 
mascott is adorable (because you cared about that). Go is a statically typed, compiled language that aims to fix a lot of the issues with more mainstream 
languages like C++ and Java.
